[ PARROT ]

A fun server that repeats what you tell him to repeat.
An original idea from Guillaume Chelfi and Yanick Méheut.

[ HISTORY ]

How can someone win an argument? By repeating one's point
of view over, and over, and over, and over, [...], and over.

Let's look at an example:

"- Dude, this movie totally rocks!
- Meh, I think it's pretty boring...
- Is not.
- Is too.
- Is not!
- Is too!
- Is not!
- Fine, you win..."

The original idea behind Parrot was this simple craving
from Chelfi and me to win every argument. The first version
of this script was written by Chelfi to tell me to shut
up. 

We made improvement when we came to the point where
we were out of ideas to implement. Obviously, the next
step was to make it "networked", and Chelfi had this
amazing idea of enabling everyone to connect to a server
to see the general trend of words.

[ REQUIREMENTS ]

All you need is Python! At the moment, we use Python2,
but a port to Python3 is definitely on our TODO list.

[ USAGE ]

parrot_server:
	Just go to the parrot_server directory and type
	the following command:

	~$ ./parrot_server.py <port>

	where port is the port the server will listen on.

	Don't forget to make the script executable by with:

	~$ chmod +x parrot_server.py
